## Example 1 – Gemini
- **Tool/model & version:** Google Gemini (2025)
- **What I asked for:** I wanted a few quick examples to practice using the assignment operator in Python.  
- **Prompt I used:** `Give me 3 examples of assignment operator in Python`  
- **What I changed before saving:** I simplified Gemini’s suggestions and kept only the ones that lined up with our lecture flow.  
- **How I checked it worked:** I ran the code cells in Colab and confirmed the outputs were correct.  

## Example 2 – ChatGPT
- **Tool/model & version:** OpenAI ChatGPT-5 (2025)
- **What I asked for:** I needed help figuring out why my Rosalind #1 solution wasn’t working.  
- **Prompt I used:** `My code for Rosalind #1 is failing. Can you debug it?`  
- **What I changed before saving:** I followed ChatGPT’s advice to cast inputs as integers and cleaned up the print statement.  
- **How I checked it worked:** I tested it with Rosalind’s sample dataset, and the output came back exactly as expected.  

## Example 3 – Perplexity
- **Tool/model & version:** Perplexity AI (2025)
- **What I asked for:** I wanted some examples of how slicing works in Python (lists and strings).  
- **Prompt I used:** `Examples of list slicing and string slicing in Python`  
- **What I changed before saving:** Perplexity’s answer was a bit wordy, so I trimmed it down and reorganized it to match our lecture notes.  
- **How I checked it worked:** I ran each snippet in Colab, and the slicing outputs looked right.  

## Example 4 – Grok
- **Tool/model & version:** Grok AI (2025)
- **What I asked for:** I wanted to know how to use dictionaries to count word frequencies.  
- **Prompt I used:** `Python dictionary example for counting words`  
- **What I changed before saving:** Grok’s solution worked but was a little too complex. I simplified it, added comments, and made sure the dictionary printed the counts clearly.  
- **How I checked it worked:** I tried it out on a sample text in Colab, and the word counts were accurate.
